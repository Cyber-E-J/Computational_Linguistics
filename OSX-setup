These are OSX setup instructions for Computational Linguistics 1.  They assume `port`, the Macports open source software environment. See [https://www.macports.org](https://www.macports.org) on installing that.


## Install virtualenv
```
sudo port install py310-virtualenv
```
Also install tkinter, which is used by NLTK graphics.
```
sudo port install py310-tkinter
```
Also install jupyterlab.  This might not be necessary, since jupyter lab is installed later in the virtual environment.
```
sudo port install py310-jupyterlab
```


## Create a virtual environment

I keep my virtual environments in `/local/sys/python`.  The following creates an environment `v10` that uses `python10`.
You can use any location.

```
cd `/local/sys/python`
virtualenv --python /opt/local/bin/python3.10 v10
```

Activate the environment and check that it is using the right python. 

```
python> source v10/bin/activate
(v10) python> python --version
Python 3.10.8
(v10) python> pip3 --version
pip 22.3.1 from /System/Volumes/Data/local/sys/python/v10/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pip (python 3.10)
(v10) python>
```

The prompt starting with `(v10)` indicates we are in the environment.

## Install and test nltk

In the `v10` environment, install nltk with pip.

```
(v10) python> pip3 install nltk
```

Also install `jupyterlab` and `svgling`.
```
pip3 install jupyterlab
pip3 install svgling
```

Go to a directory with a notebook, and start it.

```
cd /local/teach/cl23/H/H1
jupyter lab ps1a.skeleton.ipynb
```

With luck NLTK graphics will now work.


## Further notes
### Root level directories
[https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2020/01/18/creating-root-level-directories-and-symbolic-links-on-macos-catalina/](https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2020/01/18/creating-root-level-directories-and-symbolic-links-on-macos-catalina/) has instructions for creating root level writable directories like
`/local`.  Create a file `/etc/synthetic.conf`.  Here is mine.


```
cat /etc/synthetic.conf
# "System/Volumes/Data/local", a writeable location at the root of the data volume
# Link /local to it, it's used for /local/teach etc
local	System/Volumes/Data/local
```

Also create the directory `/System/Volumes/Data/local`.  Substitute your uid.
```
sudo mkdir /System/Volumes/Data/local
sudo chown uid /System/Volumes/Data/local
```

### Designating the jupyter browser
To make jupyter use the chrome browser, include this in `~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py`.
For me it resolved graphics problems.

```
# mr249 put this in to make jupyter lab open in Chrome
# after creating the config file with
# jupyter lab --generate-config
c.NotebookApp.browser = 'open -a /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app %s'
```

### Markdown viewing
The `Markdown Viewer` chrome extension can be used to display Markdown files like this one in chrome.
