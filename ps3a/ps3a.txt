Howework 3a: Fst in Python

The purpose of this assignment is set up for working with finite state transducers
in Python, and to create a version of a phonetic dictionary of English.
Submit your work in a notebook. 

Define the following sets as finite state transducers in Python.

1. The set P1 of strings of a's and b's that include at least one a and at least one b.

2. The set P2 of strings of a's and b's that have a length divisible by three. Include the
empty string.

3. The relation R3 that has a string of a's and b's on the upper side, and on the lower
side has a string of the same length, with b substituted for a, and a substituted for
b.

Hint: see page 135 of Beesley and Karttunen.

Work individually, except you can get technical help on installation on the
forum, and can ask for help on syntax and semantics on the forum.

4. You are provided with a file model.corpus which encodes a phonetic dictionary
for English.  It is not in the right format to be read directly into our FST
environment.

Explain in a paragraph the conventions which are used in these lines
of model.corpus.  Do not answer telegraphically. What orthographic
forms are encoded?  What phonetic forms are encoded?  How are
multi-character symbols and empty strings used? 

b}B a}AE1 n}NG k}K s|h}SH a}EH2 r}R e}_ s}Z

s}S k}K i|r}ER1 m}M i}IH0 s|h}SH i}IH0 n|g}NG

l}L a}EY1 t}T e}_

Assume 's|h', AE1, and NG are multi-character symbols, and similarly for other cases.

5. In Python, use Fst operations to create a relation R4 that represents the three words above.
The upper side should represent spelling forms, but using multi-character symbols such as
's|h' where model.corpus uses them.  The lower side should have phonetic forms.

Maintain the alignment between spelling forms and phonetic forms that is seen in model.corpus.
Draw the machine and comment on how one sees that alignment is maintained. Verify that
multi-character symbols are used as desired and comment on it.

Work individually on problems 4 and 5.  Discuss methodology on the forum in the usual way.

6. In Python, create a finite state transducer ENGLISH that is based on model.fst.
It should have the same structure as the solution to 5.  It should have approximately
135000 paths.

Suggested strategy: Use a python program to transform model.corpus into a file that
is appropriate for reading into the Python environment. Figure out how to read a
transducer from a file.

Submit tests showing that ENGLISH maps between spelling and phonetic forms in the
desired way. Testing should be about 1/3 of the effort.

Work in groups of up to three on problem 6. Each member should submit
the solution. Bring up and correct any apparent errors in the file
model.corpus.  Discuss methodology and conventions on the forum.
